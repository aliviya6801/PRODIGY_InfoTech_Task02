        <center><h2 id="tex">The invention and development of electronic calculators can be attributed to several key individuals and advancements. The earliest electronic calculators emerged in the mid-20th century:
            <br>In the 1940s and 1950s, a few pioneers made significant contributions to electronic calculators. One notable figure was Konrad Zuse, a German engineer who is often regarded as the creator of the first programmable computer. In 1941, Zuse's machine, the Z3, utilized electromechanical relays for calculation.
            <br>Another important contributor was Howard Aiken, an American computer scientist who designed the Harvard Mark I computer, which became operational in 1944. Although not a hand-held calculator, the Harvard Mark I was one of the early programmable computing machines.
            <br>In 1948, the American engineer and physicist, John W. Mauchly, and the mathematician, J. Presper Eckert, developed the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), one of the earliest general-purpose electronic digital computers. ENIAC was not a compact calculator but laid the foundation for the development of electronic computing devices.
            <br>The true handheld electronic calculator, as we know it today, was developed in the early 1960s. In 1961, Texas Instruments engineers Jack Kilby and Jerry Merryman, along with engineer James Van Tassel, created the first working prototype of a pocket-sized electronic calculator using integrated circuits. It was powered by batteries and capable of performing basic arithmetic operations.
            <br>In 1964, the American company, Sharp Corporation, released the first commercial transistorized calculator known as the "CS-10A." It was a desktop calculator that featured basic arithmetic functions.
            <br>The groundbreaking invention came in 1967 when Texas Instruments introduced the pocket-sized "Cal Tech" or "Pocketronic." This compact calculator was the first to use only integrated circuits and became the first commercially successful handheld electronic calculator. It revolutionized the industry and paved the way for further advancements.
            <br>Throughout the 1970s, electronic calculators became more affordable, compact, and accessible to the general public. Manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard, Casio, and Sharp played significant roles in advancing calculator technology and introducing new features like scientific functions, memory storage, and programmability.
            <br>Over the decades, electronic calculators have continued to evolve, becoming more powerful, versatile, and integrated with various additional features.</h2></center>
